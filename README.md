Hi!

My name is Patrick, and I am an aspiring software developer.
I am currently a student studying an undergrad in IT with a major in Information Systems and Business Analysis.
I have interests in Python, SQL and back end development in general.
I will be looking to develop some basic projects which will be available on my Github, in the near future.

Thanks for reading!
